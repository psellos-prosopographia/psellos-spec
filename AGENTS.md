# Agent Guidelines

- This repository defines contracts only (schemas, vocabularies, spec documents).
- Do not add application code, build logic, or UI concerns.
- Keep core SNAP-aligned concepts separate from Psellos extensions.
- Any breaking change requires a new version entry in CHANGELOG.md.
- Do not edit other repositories from this context.
